### Comments
This was the last week for dev logs (covering last week) so sorry to say its another missed log!

That said to provide some feedback about the final deliverables:

Your final presentation should focus on the development of the project and have some visual aids (not your code!) that goes over your algorithms and any major issues you encountered.

The final report should explicitly state the final input / output for your functions, a summary of the output on your full dataset (when possible), **and a description / statement with proof about how your algorithm was tested and why it is correct.** 

Lastly your readme should have a description of the location of all major code / data / deliverables as well as compiling and running instructions for each of your algorithms individually! I want to be able to run BFS, Dijkstras, and betweenness-centrality on your full dataset and reproduce the results. I also need to be able to compile and run your tests (it is very likely that an executable will not run on my machine like it has on yours -- be sure I can compile the code myself!).

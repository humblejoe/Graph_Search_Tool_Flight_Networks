This is two weeks of feedback in one because you are missing a feedback log.

Immediately I'd ask for a bit more formatting in the dev logs -- it would be nice if I could clearly see 

### Goals for the week

(I gave a hint as a possible formatting in this feedback log). Some groups also separate out questions they have for me directly which is always nice to answer.

Outside of that both weeks look good. I've seen significant improvement to your proposal and its clear you are moving in the right direction. You may want to improve the resolution of your target goals / tasks though -- its easy to say 'we will do BFS' but its more useful to say 'We will complete data parsing and test it to make sure that we can create an adjacency matrix.', 'We will implement BFS on the adjacency matrix', 'We will test BFS on a small subset of nodes to make sure it works'. 

That suggestions comes because I can give better weekly feedback if I have a clear sense of what specific functions / tasks you are doing. It's harder to be helpful if the best feedback I can give is 'yeah BFS should probably be done before Dijkstras'.

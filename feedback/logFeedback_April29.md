Apologies for the late feedback!

Glad to see a reasonable amount of forward progress and test cases being developed. Also glad to see you've resolved the segfault error in your dataset. 

Be sure when completing BFS / Dijkstras that you have clear input / output values. I would also suggest writing up the README as you develop the algorithms so you can give clear information about where the code / data is located and how each function can be run (and what the expected output format is).

Team Seg Fools Contract

1. **Communication**

Meetings: We plan on having at least two weekly meetings, with one on Wednesday at 3 PM, another throughout the week if needed. If a group member cannot attend a meeting it should be communicated through discord promptly.

Assistance: If a group member requires assistance, they should reach out through discord and expect a response within the day. Assistance is meant to guide you in the right direction, not completely do your part. If assistance is needed from a staff member, a group member experiencing the issue is expected to promptly contact staff members through discord or office hours.

Respect: Our group agrees to consider all other members’ opinions and ideas. Do not wait until the last minute to do your part then rely on the team to do it for you. Let the group know when you are not going to be there.

2. **Collaboration**

**Work Distribution:**

- We will divide the entire work in small chunks and distribute evenly amongst each other.
- Each week all of us will be assigned a certain quantity of work and we will monitor the progress each week during the meetings.
- If someone is struggling with their part they can come up to any of the team members and they would be given assistance.
3. **Conflict Resolution**
- As a group if we disagree on something we will put it to a vote.
- If there is something which is not resolved, we will bring it to the notice of the staff.

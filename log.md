 Week of April 1st: Picked up the social netwrok graph and chose the algporithms(BFS, Dijkstra, Brandes Algorithm). We realized we need to change our dataset since we these algorithms were not applicable on it. 
    - Our goal was to work on the project proposal and meet with our TA to get the project proposal approved. 
    - We all worked on call everyday around 5 to discuss the proposal ideas and dataset.
    - We had to rethink our dataset because some of the algorithms were not working it.
    - Get our proposal approved and log.

Week of April 7th: We uploaded a new datset,(the airport dataset), applying BFS, Dijkstra and Travellinng salesman problem. We noticed that our dataset did not meet the requirements for travelling salesman problem. We changed the third algorithm to Johnson's algorithm to find the betweenness centrality. 
    - Our goal for this week was to finish the project proposal. 
    - We all worked on call everyday around 5 to discuss the proposal ideas and dataset.
    - We encountered problems with error handling such as erroneous records, for example if some edge was missing edge weight or its end point we needed to take that into account into account.
    -We plan to create the make file, BFS and start with Dijkstra's algorithm.
